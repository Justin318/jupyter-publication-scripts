## TODO
- rewrite revtex_nocode.tplx so that it can be inherited from nicely
- modify preprocessors so that they only work if conversion to latex is made
- make nicer example notebook

## Some ideas that would be nice to implement in the future
- caption for tables in MD
- write nbextension to show captions (and references?) in browser
- ask for merging bibtex preprocessor into cite2c extension git
